Edited by Benson Muchemi
DESCRIPTION
The Eago development board contains a series of Microcontroller boards compatible with STM32Cube IDE and Arduino IDE.
Also contains ESP microcontroller(ESP8285) that are on-board and compatible with arduino with pinout extension and enables wifi connectivity.
Eago V1 kits and boards ship with an STM32F103 Chip packaged in a manner that is both beginner friendly and also feature-packed for intermediate hobbyists.
The Eago V1 board has its shield compatible with the board.
At the core is 72MHz ARM Cortex M3 with 64Kb of flash memory. The board ships with an inbuilt USB to Serial interface(cp2102) making it easy to program and SWD interface for easy debugging.
